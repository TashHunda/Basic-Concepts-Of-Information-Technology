## Types of Computers
+ Network computers
+ Laptops
+ Personal computer
+ Minicomputer

## Components of a computer system
+ Hardware -The tangible parts of the computer. eg Moniter
+ Software -The intangible parts of the computer. eg Programs that instruct hardware
+ Human Aspect -What brings all the components together. eg Human working on the computer

## Hardware
+ Central part of the computer, which is made up of
  + The Processor: works hand in hand with the CPU
  + Memory: ROM and RAM
  +Storage: Hard disk and removable storage 
  
## The CPU
+ Different types: AMD Athlon, Intel Pentium and Celerion
+ Speed measured in megabertz. This is important becasue the faster processor the more work can be performed.

## Memory
+ The computer needs to store data and programs
+ 2 types of memory permanent and volatile
+ Measured in bytes: 1 byte= 8 bits

## RAM Random Access Memory
+ Used as Working memory, holds working programs and any information that is being used by that program
+ Can be accesed easily
+ Faster than permanent storage

## Storage Hard Disk
+ Permanent memory- stores everything else that is not currently being used by the computer.
+ Slower
+ Bigger that RAM

## Other types of Storage
+ Zip drive
+ Floppy Disks
+ CD/DVD
+ External Hard drive

## Software
+ Made up of code
+ Written in programming languages - Java, c++
+ 2 kinds of software System and Application

## System Software
+ Mainly concerned with the computer
+ Operating System : This is what makes the computer run
+ Examples of OS : Windows and Mac

## Application Software
+ controls everything else besides the computer
+ Used for things you want the computer to execute.
